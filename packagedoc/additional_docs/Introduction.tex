The \pkg\ extend the functionality of the \rfwcore\ by some useful keywords.

This covers for example string operations like normalizing a path and a pretty print method (especially for composite Python data types).

The sources of the \pkg\ are available in \href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-extensions-collection}{GitHub}.

Informations about how to install the \pkg\ can be found in the \href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-extensions-collection/blob/develop/README.rst}{README}.

The \pkg\ keywords are implemented in Python (as \textbf{PythonExtensionsCollection}) and the implementation can also be found in
