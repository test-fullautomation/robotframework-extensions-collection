Package Description
===================

The **RobotframeworkExtensions** extend the functionality of the **Robot Framework** by some useful keywords.

How to install
--------------

The **RobotframeworkExtensions** can be installed in two different ways.

1. Installation via PyPi (recommended for users)

   .. code::

      pip install RobotframeworkExtensions

   `RobotframeworkExtensions in PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/robotframework-extensions-collection/>`_

2. Installation via GitHub (recommended for developers)

   * Clone the **robotframework-extensions-collection** repository to your machine.

     .. code::

        git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-extensions-collection.git

     `RobotframeworkExtensions in GitHub <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-extensions-collection>`_

   * Use the following command to install **RobotframeworkExtensions** (executed in repository main folder):

     .. code::

        python -m pip install .

     Or:

     .. code::

        python -m pip install --proxy <proxy> .

     This command will also download and install all dependencies that are required to work with the source files in the current repository.
     After the initial installation of **RobotframeworkExtensions** is done, you have the following two possibilities:

     1. *Clean the previous installation*:

        .. code::

           python "./cleanup_installation.py"

        ``cleanup_installation.py`` explicitly deletes all files and folders within the component installation folder under
        ``site-packages`` and also deletes local build artefacts.

     2. *Render the component documentation*:

        .. code::

           python "./genpackagedoc.py"

        This would e.g. be required in case of changes in the interface of **RobotframeworkExtensions**.

        The documentation is rendered by a separate application called **GenPackageDoc**, that is part
        of the build dependencies and runtime dependencies of **RobotframeworkExtensions**.

        **GenPackageDoc** needs to be configured. Details about how to do this, can be found in the
        `README.rst <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-genpackagedoc/blob/develop/README.rst>`_
        (sections *Install dependencies* and *Configure dependencies*).

   * Use the following command to build **RobotframeworkExtensions** (executed in repository main folder):

     .. code::

        python -m build .

     Or:

     .. code::

        python -m pip config set global.proxy <proxy>
        python -m build .
